# Base Mappings Exercise

This repository contains my implementation of the mappings exercise from the [Base Learn platform](https://docs.base.org/base-learn/docs/mappings/mappings-exercise/).

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how mappings work in Solidity.
- Practise using mappings for data storage and retrieval.
- Strengthen my smart contract development skills on Base.

## Project Details

- **Language**: Solidity
- **Tools**: Foundry
- **Chain**: Base (testnet)

## Structure

- `src/`: Includes the Solidity contract for the mappings exercise.
- `test/`: Includes tests for the smart contract to verify correctness.

## Progress
Badges Earned: 5 out of 13
